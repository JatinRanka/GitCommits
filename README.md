<h1>Git Commits</h1>
<h2>How the commits are checked?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the changes are less than 10, it is considered improper commit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Issues with the Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Github API does not list all the commits. Hence some commits can be missing while calculating the result</li>
<li>All the repositories are not shown by github API. Only 30 are shown. Hence, all repositories cannot be checked.</li>
<li>The rate limit given by github is 60 and it may exceed while running the project. Hence, use pshiphon in order check more repositories.</li>
</ul>
